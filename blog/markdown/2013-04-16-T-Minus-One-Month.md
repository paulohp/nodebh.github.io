It is now one month away from the conference. Are you excited yet? 

## Tickets

They are on sale now for $50. They are going quickly, so [get one while they last](http://nodepdx.eventbrite.com). 

## Dance Party

Yup, that dance party we've been talking about, totes happening on Thursday night. We've booked an amazing local electro-pop band to open the night: Ask You In Gray. Turns out they also just released a new album. Go check it out on [http://askyouingray.com](http://askyouingray.com).

## CFP Is Over (or is it?)

The CFP officially ended on April 8th, but then we had some great late submissions after the deadline. We're firm believers that rules are made to be broken, so please, if you're holding out on us and have this amazing talk you want to give, [submit a proposal](https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/tree/master/proposals) soon, or the schedule will be full of OTHER awesome talks and it will be too late. We're rolling through the submissions now and contacting folks individually, so if you submitted a talk and we haven't gotten back to you yet, sit tight, you'll hear from us soon!

## Speakers

#### Aron Racho

The phrase "Romancing the Stone" is a piece of jewelers' jargon, referring to a step in preparing a gem for use in jewelry. It's also one of first films directed by the great Robert Zemeckis, who gave us such classics as Back To The Future, Forrest Gump, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. But we're not here to talk movies, or are we? Aron Racho, a talented guitar player and reformed Java developer, will tell us of his own journey to love JavaScript, which we will henceforth refer to using our own special jargon as "Bromancing the Node". I'm not completely sure what "bromancing" is, but Aron will be sharing that with us, straight from El Corazon.

#### Christopher Meiklejohn ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/cmeik), [GitHub](https://github.com/cmeiklejohn))

    "Substitute damn every time you're inclined to write very; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be." - Mark Twain

Excellent quote. Christopher Meiklejohn is damn smart. Where's my editor? Apparently I don't have the "damn.vim" plugin loaded. Whatever. Christopher is a functional, but somewhat reactive (banana) programmer, who enjoys JavaScript and long walks through execution stacks on a mild summers eve. 

#### Max Ogden ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxogden), [GitHub](https://github.com/maxogden))

You probably know who Max is already... but did you know, that if Max's parents had chosen the name "Mae" instead, that Mae Ogden is an anagram for "Node Game"?? That would have been sweet because he's totally going to talk about Node and gaming. Ok, well, not really Node, specifically, Minecraft in the browser, in JavaScript (of course), and the nearly 100 modules that are part of this pretty nifty project called [voxel.js](http://voxeljs.com/) that make it possible.

#### Tracy Abrahms ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/HackyGoLucky), [GitHub](https://github.com/hackygolucky))

Mario, or "マリオ" in Japanese, is one of my favourite 8-bit plumbers. Knowing no fear, Mario mercilessly punches rocks, gathers gold coins, and has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of surplus energy to use for running, jumping, and shimmying up and down large drain pipes. I don't know if Tracy is a plumber as well, but I do know, that like Mario, punching rocks is a favoured pastime. What does this have to do with JavaScript you ask? I'll let Tracy explain that in a month. Anticipation is the best thing ever. Or you could just [read the PR](https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/blob/master/proposals/punching-rocks_tracy-abrahms.md). 

#### Zach Babb ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/zkbabb), [GitHub](https://github.com/zachbabb))

    "Yo dawg, I heard you liked computers, so I put a computer in your computer so you could computer while you computer."

This is a direct, verbatim quote (not really) from my favourite person-whose-last-name-is-the-name-of-a-cartoon-bunny, Zach Babb (ok, it was Babs, not Babb, but close, I say, and its a great mnemonic device). In all seriousness (it's opposite day), Zach is going to show us how to build a computer in your browser. Hmmm... Should this be on the hardware track or the software track; I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE.


## Sponsors

#### Basho

[Basho](http://basho.com) is my favourite group of Erlang nerds that make rhizomatic distributed software. Did you know that Riak means ripple in Indonesian (though more commonly used as a root meaning "yell"), and that ripple is just a common name for a capillary wave? So glad they didn't name the database "Capillary Wave".

#### Jive

Let's clear some space and dance. What it is, Mama! Whether you're doing a lively six step, confusing an Airplane attendant with your unique dialectic, or just wanting a decent collaboration platform for your "enterprise" (do enterprises call themselves enterprises, or just businesses?), [Jive Software](http://www.jivesoftware.com) is the place to be, hep cat. They were also the first Portland company I heard of that had a beer tap in their office break room. Just sayin. 

#### Sticker Mule

Stickers are some of the best things ever. Last year, we gave out "Do Not Disturb, Noding in Progress" stickers, which were quite nice. This year, [Sticker Mule](http://stickermule.com) is providing all of our stickers for free. Shiny, captain.
