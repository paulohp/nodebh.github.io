Hello fellow Nodistas, and welcome back to the party. NodePDX is coming back for another year. When we first got together a few months back, we were over-the-top excited, putting together details and hatching our initial plans. Now that we’ve begun booking speakers and nailing down some of the details, we’re more confident than ever that this is going to be a phenomenal conference. We just can't contain our excitement, so we'll be keeping all of you in the loop about what’s going on.

## Location

This year, NodePDX will be held at the lovely [Holocene](http://www.holocene.org/) in Southeast PDX, on [10th and SE Morrison](https://plus.google.com/118433524027456539719/about?gl=us&hl=en). Though Holocene is usually thought of as a music venue (and one of the best in town at that), it also turns out to be a wonderful place for a tech conference. It's spacious, aesthetically sleek, technologically well equipped, and located in the heart of the up-and-coming inner Southeast. And let's be honest: the fact that it's already a dance club doesn't hurt, now does it?

## Speakers

#### Ward Cunningham ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/WardCunningham), [GitHub](https://github.com/WardCunningham?tab=repositories))

Let’s call a spade a spade: as the inventor of the wiki, Ward is one of the most important figures in the history of digital information exchange. But, not content to rest on figurative laurels, Ward continues to be very active in the Portland tech scene and remains a prolific innovator. Last year Ward shared with us a wonderful, Node/JavaScript-driven example of that; his [The Smallest Federated Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki). This year, we'll see a deep dive, from solder to css, showing how data is surfaced from DIY sensors at Ward's home, then shared onto a federated wiki page via a custom DSL.

#### Nexxy ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/nexxylove), [GitHub](https://github.com/nexxy))

Nexxy, developer at [Ninja Blocks](http://ninjablocks.com/) and future overlord of the Internet of Things, doesn’t so much "give talks" as provide wonderfully bizarre multimedia experiences, complete with robots, smoke machines, strobe lights, and house music, all tied together with heavy doses of JavaScript. Not only that, but Nexxy is helping organize our hardware track, so we're pretty sure your mind is going to be blown, one way or another, possibly two or three ways at the same time.

#### Jerry Sievert ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/jerrysievert), [GitHub](https://github.com/JerrySievert))

Jerry loves building things, and is the resident JavaScript guru at [Esri](http://www.esri.com/)’s Portland R&D Center (formerly [Geoloqi](https://geoloqi.com/)). If you’ve been to [Bailey’s Taproom](http://www.baileystaproom.com/) here in PDX, then you’ve seen Jerry’s handiwork without knowing it, as Jerry managed to string together the series of behind-the-scenes [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) that now power the Bailey’s digital interface. We've seen Jerry chillin' with an [Arduino](http://legitimatesounding.com/blog/Evented_Arduino_with_Node_js.html) wired up to an Apple computing product with JavaScript code on the console. Awesome. Jerry and Nexxy are cohorting to organize the hardware track and just might teach you how to solder, if you ask nicely.

#### Hannah Fouasnon ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/hanelifou), [GitHub](https://github.com/fouasnon))

Hannah was a co-founder of [LuckySort](http://luckysort.com/) and is currently the co-founder of and developer for [DJZ](http://djz.com/), an online resource for DJs and those who love them. Portland is still mourning the loss of our favorite former marine parasitology researcher to sunny San Francisco, so we're really excited Hannah is coming back for this. So, yeah, we've got make sure NodePDX is the most Portlandy thing that Portland has ever Portlanded just to make Hannah jealous.

#### Jason Denizac ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/leJDen), [GitHub](https://github.com/jden))

Jason is currently a JavaScript dev at [Agile Diagnosis](http://www.agilediagnosis.com/) and is self-described as a health technologist. Another semi-Portlander living in the Bay Area, Jason is both a highly prolific contributor to the JavaScript community and a staunch proponent of working on things that matter. Some people talk the talk, but Jason walks the walk, evidenced via a sincere commitment to improving the state of technology in the health care industry.

## Sponsors

#### Portland Incubator Experiment (PIE PDX)

[PIE PDX](http://www.piepdx.com) is a startup incubator in the fullest sense. Seriously, you just put little misshapen idea-eggs into this box over on NW Davis and 12th, and fully-formed and fully-funded startups pop out, all warm and fuzzy making weird little chirping noises. To the companies that are lucky enough to land a spot in one of PIE’s yearly Accelerator classes (thousands apply and only six make it), PIE offers far more than a friendly/funky shared office space and a kegerator: it offers graphic design resources, dedicated advisors, a wealth of camaraderie, and far more. Recent graduates of PIE include [AppThwack](https://appthwack.com), [Stublisher](http://stublisher.com/), [Lytics](http://lytics.io/), and others. We’re thrilled to have this crucial Portland institution as a sponsor.

#### Silicon Florist (Media Sponsor)

Want the inside scoop on what's happening in the so-called [Silicon Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Forest)? Stop by our favorite not-really-a-flower-shop, [Silicon Florist](http://www.siliconflorist.com). Here you'll find only the best in independent Portland-focused tech news, guaranteed to be only as biased as [Rick Turoczy](http://twitter.com/turoczy)'s very well-informed opinion. We're super-grateful for their help spreading the word about NodePDX. So go read some stuff, check out the job board, and become one of the 1000 beautiful flowers that the Silicon Florist has helped to grow.


## More to Come

Well friends, that's all that we have to share at the moment, but stay tuned: we have lots more coming soon -- more speakers, more sponsors, more details. In fact, maybe you could be part of our next post? Our CFP is open now, so go ahead, [suggest a speaker](http://nodepdx.org/#speakers) or [submit a talk](http://nodepdx.org/#speakers)! 

Does this look like the kind of thing your company would want to support? We have sponsorship opportunities available as well. Contact [Troy Howard](mailto:thoward37@gmail.com?Subject=[NodePDX]%20Sponsorship) for more info.

Oh, and while I was standing in line for brunch the other day, an early little bird, happily munching on a worm, told me that tickets might be going on sale sometime next week, and they will be surprisingly cheep... I mean cheap (dang bird metaphors!).

Please come back and visit us here on [the blog](http://nodepdx.org/#blog) and [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/nodepdx) for more info as we go along!
