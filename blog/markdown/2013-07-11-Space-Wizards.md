## Hi there, NodePDX-pats!

It's been two months since you walked out the doors of [Holocene](http://www.holocene.org/), called your mom, and cried about NodePDX 2013 being over. Well, don't worry. We're still here, and we still love you!
Here's some proof:


## Videos

All the videos. Yep. All of the talks were recorded and the videos are up at [http://video.nodepdx.org](http://video.nodepdx.org) ... and, as a special bonus gift, we're finally getting around to post-processing and uploading the [NodePDX 2012 videos](http://video.nodepdx.org/category/2/nodepdx-2012), which if you scroll to the bottom, you will the ones that are ready. I almost forgot how great those talks were. More coming soon.


## Extra Swag
I can't believe we have extra swag, but we do. Did you walk off without a stack of stickers? Ugh. Well, if you didn't get enough stickers and t-shirts, do not hesitate to email [troy@nodepdx.org](mailto:troy@nodepdx.org) and request a gift package. I'll personally deliver it if you're in Portland. If you're outside of the Portland area, fear not, we'll mail it to ya.


## Git Tip
So our speakers are freakin' awesome people. They write code, get up in front of crowds to talk, travel to Portland, and are also normal humans in most capacities. Further, you might have noticed that you paid a very low price for your conference ticket. Even further, the speakers were not paid. In fact most of them found their own way to the conference and were not even lavished with gifts of free semi-organic kombucha like you might have expected they would be.

Have you heard of [GitTip](https://www.gittip.com/)? It's a great way to give back to the developers who make the software you love and use on a daily basis.

    "Yo bro, do you even GitTip?" - Every Hobrogrammer Ever


So here's the deal, I'm [guilt tripping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation) you, RIGHT NOW. This is some serious [fashion-mag style guilt tripping](http://www.psu.edu/dept/medialab/researchpage/newabstracts/fashion.html). You are not good enough, as a human, if you don't go cough up some dough on GitTip for your favourite speaker. I'm serious. It's cheap! Like a quarter a week (you can do that).

Show your love for these folks. Let them know you appreciate the work they do. Give them a GitTip.

To make it easy, here's the GitTip link for each speaker:

## Other Events
Ok, so whether or not you give a GitTip to one of our speakers (which you totally should), you DEFINITELY should come be part of one of these upcoming events:


#### Nodebots Day Portland
https://tito.io/pdxnode/nodebotsday

You may have heard about [Nodebots Day](https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday)? If not, let me tell you about it. It's a day-long meetup, wherein we build robots, ostensibly powered by Node.js. This will be lots of fun. It's free, and coming up real soon on 7/27 (day after [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013)).


#### CascadiaJS 2013
http://2013.cascadiajs.com/

You might have attended [CascadiaJS last year](http://2012.cascadiajs.com/) in Seattle. It's the grown-up version of NodePDX, for the entire [bio-region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_(bioregion)), not just our fine city, Portland. It's coming up in November, this time in Vancouver, B.C. If you would like to speak at this conference, the [CFP is now open](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2013.cascadiajs.com).


#### JingJS
http://jingjs.org/

You might like Chinese food.. and JavaScript. Go to the source, Beijing, and enjoy JavaScript, cooking up some sweet new-fangle-brackets in the hottest wok on the block. I bet you thought you knew who all the JavaScript developers in the world were.. bet you haven't met [FengMK2](https://github.com/fengmk2), [GoddyZhao](https://github.com/goddyzhao), or [Charlie Crane](https://github.com/xiecc). Join us, and explore the vibrant Chinese developer community, and see one of the coolest cities on the planet. If you would like to speak at this conference, the [CFP is now open](https://github.com/jsconfcn/jingjs/tree/master/proposals) (note: speakers get free airfare/lodging, a ~$2k value).


#### RealTime Conf
http://realtimeconf.com/

Ok, flying to China might not be in the cards. But you know what is? The best damned conference you've ever heard of, right in your own backyard, Realtime Conf and it's sister-conf, [RedisConf](http://2013.redisconf.com/). Go learn you some realtime. They'll be there all week.


#### PDXNode
http://www.meetup.com/nodepdx/

Join us every month for a meetup where we'll talk about IRC (ok, not really, we sometimes talk about other things like how JavaScript powers our favourite [local karaoke bar](http://voiceboxpdx.com/), flying quadcopters, streams, domains, and stuff).


#### IRC
Come chat with us on the [#pdxnode channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pdxnode). We'd love to share our favourite gifs with you.
