NodePDX is a week away folks, and there's a bunch of stuff to tell you about. Before I do though, I want to ask you a very important question:

### Have you shared your enthusiasm today?

I want everyone who reads this to go post on Twitter or Facebook, send an email the "All" list at your company, text your parents, and/or leave a nice note on the fridge for your cat, sharing your enthusiasm for JavaScript, Node, hacking, and hopefully, our little conference. 

Conferences are the most fun when all your friends and colleagues are there to share it with you, or at least are aware that you are doing something fun and they're not. If you can't share the experience with them, then try to make them feel bad for missing out. :)

There ARE still tickets available for only $50: [http://nodepdx.eventbrite.com](http://nodepdx.eventbrite.com)

That said, folks can join us from home! We're excited to be working with [NextDay Video](http://www.nextdayvideo.com/) (the folks who do [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org)) to live stream and record the conference. We're also going to be chatting it up on IRC in the [#nodepdx](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nodepdx) channel. So, please, share with your friends and let them enjoy this awesome experience with us.

## Music

[Bob Marley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley) once said "One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain" and [Friedrich Nietzsche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) said "Without music, life would be a mistake.". I bet you didn't know how much they had in common. 
 
We are pretty into music also, and think that without music, NodePDX would be a mistake. That's why in addition to [Ask You In Gray](http://askyouingray.com), the awesome electro pop band we told you about last time, we've booked [DJ Monika Mhz](https://twitter.com/monikamhz) for the after party (thanks to [Angelina Fabbro](https://twitter.com/angelinamagnum) for the hookup). Want to get in the mood early? Check out Monika's SoundCloud page: https://soundcloud.com/monika-mhz

We also signed up two *awesome speakers* who are going to talk about music. [Matthew Lyon](https://twitter.com/mattly), famous for being a local Ruby know-it-all, is going to discuss asynchronous programming techniques for music in Node.js and [Substack](https://twitter.com/substack), the face that launched a thousand [NPM modules](https://npmjs.org/~substack), is going to talk about generating music and sound in the browser and in node. You'll be beeping and booping your earbuds out in no time.


## Messages

Speaking of music, I love that song "[Message In A Bottle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G2LtPvPemw)" by The Police, but there's lots of other ways to send out messages. [Brock Whitten](https://twitter.com/sintaxi) is going to cover most of them in his talk about messaging patterns, and [Wraithan](https://twitter.com/wraithan) is going to dive deep into pub/sub and writing IRC bots. Also, just for fun, we're going to have a public IRC station setup at the conf logged into the [#nodepdx](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nodepdx) channel, so you can just sidle over and troll your peers anonymously. Look out!


## Massages

If you were at NodePDX [last year](http://2012.nodepdx.org/), you might have gotten a chillaxing massage from [Domenika Radonich](https://twitter.com/NicheMassage) of [Niche Massage](http://nichemassage.com/). If not, then let me tell you, you missed a better you. Did you know that Domenika specializes in body work for programmers? Yup. There's actually a thing about sitting in chairs and typing all day long that causes really specific problems in your back. Domenika knows how to fix 'em and will have a chair setup ready to help out... for free, from 12-4pm on both days. Do not miss this opportunity to relax.


## Security

A good massage can be as relaxing as [Linus' favorite security blanket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_van_Pelt#Security_blanket). Even better than that though, is [nodesecurity.io](http://nodesecurity.io/), your Node.js security blanket. This project is so important that we've invited [Adam Baldwin](https://twitter.com/adam_baldwin), of [^Lift security](http://liftsecurity.io/) and [&yet](http://andyet.com/) to tell you the "how and why" of security in Node. Adam will be explaining this new project, why it's important and how you can help. 

## Flying Things

[Bloomberg asserts](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2013/0327/Drones-above-New-York-scary-but-inevitable-Mayor-Bloomberg-says-video) that drones make you feel more safe too. Well, at least they are a *lot of fun*, so forget about your surveillance worries and geek out writing code for them. [Walmart Labs](http://www.walmartlabs.com/), one of our newest sponsors, has bought a bunch of [Parrot AR Drones](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) (aka [NodeCopters](http://nodecopter.com/)), which we will have at the event.

Specifically, from 6-8pm on Thursday night we'll have a Hackathon, which is being co-organized by [Alex Donn](https://twitter.com/Alex_Donn) of [AT&T](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz3c8H-_ubw) and [Ben Acker](https://twitter.com/nvcexploder) of [PDXNode](http://www.meetup.com/nodepdx/) (our alter ego). We've gotten approval from [the venue](http://www.holocene.org/) for flying dangerous things around in their lofty ceiling, and there's a great open air field a block away for more adventurous flying. Yes!

ALSO [Forrest Norvell](https://twitter.com/othiym23) of [New Relic](http://newrelic.com) will be presenting on the deep-dark guts of the Node runtime. You're probably wondering why I'm mentioning this in the "Flying Things" section. That's because Forrest is also really into [JavaScript controlled](https://github.com/othiym23/node-wifli) [camera-weilding](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Toy-Concept-Spi-Helicopter/dp/B008BY1S62) [mini-helicopters](http://www.amazon.com/Wi-Indoor-Outdoor-Hobby-Helicopter/dp/B0050NN6US), and will have some of those handy during the hackathon. SO MANY FLYING THINGS. Bring a helmet and eye protection.

## Extremely Smart Things

So Forrest's talk might be a little brain-bending, but we're not stopping there. We've got more extremely smart things lined up than you'll be able to grok in a lifetime. 

First things first though, we think [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org), another one of our sponsors, did one of the smartest things we've heard of in a long time. [Fifteen years ago](http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/04/02/15-years-of-a-better-web/) they started a non-profit company to ensure that the web remained free, innovative and well-intentioned. They've done a marvelous job of that, and we're really proud of them.

In honour of Mozilla's birthday, we've lined up this list of smarty-pants to present:

[Paul Jungwirth](https://github.com/pjungwir); who casually states in his resume that he studied Greek, Latin, Distributed Computing, Machine Learning, Other Topics (tm) at Harvard, and has a Masters in Classical Studies, AND a Batchelors in English, AND he's an Eagle Scout. Do you feel unworthy yet? I know I do. He's also going to share some state-of-the-art error handling tactics with these new fangled things called clusters and domains.

[Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman); who has a [great and prolific blog](http://www.hanselman.com/), regularly publishes a list of [really useful tools](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2011UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx), and socially-hacked Microsoft into letting [his open-source ideals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sunoAP8XKBY) transform the company while he lounges about in [his home office](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Show-Us-Your-Tech/Show-Us-Your-Home-Scott-Hanselman-Edition) here in sleepy little Portland. This guy wins. He's also stylish, clever, and has a devilishly handsome forehead.
  
[Chris Dickinson](https://github.com/chrisdickinson); shows up in a nice dark red color in my IRC client. That's because Chris is a stone cold killa, who makes the streams of Node.js run red with blood of slayed code problems... and he implements git. [In the browser](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git.js). 
 
[Mike McNeil](https://twitter.com/mikermcneil); Hails from Texas, has an [AngelList entry](https://angel.co/mikermcneil), and is a self-proclaimed hustler-hipster who effectively used "[Balderdash](http://www.chellman.org/toys/balderdash/)" in a sentence (and  has the company name to prove it).. Mike will be sharing his secret to success: [Sails.js](http://balderdashy.github.io/sails/)
 
[Charlie Key](https://twitter.com/Zwigby); Hails from Ohio, is NOT a [plumber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_the_Plumber), might be a [paranoid ferret](http://thefluffingtonpost.com/post/39680997713/paranoid-ferret-thinks-someone-is-right-behind), might have an extremely attractive website for the company he founded called Modulus.io (seriously, check it out.. suave!), and will be telling you about building cute video games like [Pillow Pets World](https://pillowpetsworld.com/) that ONLY have 10 million kids playing them at the same time. Ahem.

[Ryan Jarvinen](https://twitter.com/ryanj); Works for RedHat; winning. Spells 0akland with a zero; winning. Uses extended characters in his Twitter name; winning. Submitted [like](https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/blob/master/proposals/MongoDB_in_the_browser_and_Realtime_apps_with_Meteor-ryan_jarvinen.md) [4](https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/blob/master/proposals/building_spatial_apps_with_mongodb-ryan_jarvinen.md) [different](https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/blob/master/proposals/clustering_node_on_openshift-ryan_jarvinen.md) [talks](https://github.com/nodepdx/nodepdx.github.com/blob/master/proposals/social_irc_bots_w_mongodb-ryan_jarvinen.md), all of them super interesting, and caused this organizer hours of agony deciding which one to accept; worth it. In case you're wondering which one it is, it's the one about release management, deployment pipelines, OpenStack and Node.js Clusters.

[JChris](https://twitter.com/jchris); Evidence of his extreme smarts? JChris [realized Portland is better than Bay Area, and finally moved back](http://jchris.ic.ht/drl/_design/sofa/_list/post/post-page?startkey=%5B%22Returning-to-Portland%22%5D). That and co-founding Couchbase, which has the cleverest JavaScript related t-shirt slogan ever: "[You had me at JSON](http://thought-palace.tumblr.com/post/49947724184/douglas-crockford-javascript-guru-and-originator)". He's going to talk about atomic operators, distributed analytics, the "Twitter Firehose", and your going to get smarter by listening to him.

## Extremely Fun Things

If that wasn't enough... We're also going to have a spoonful of sugary fun to help the "smart stuff" medicine go down.

What's more fun than [HorseJS](https://twitter.com/horse_js)? We agree, nothing is more fun than HorseJS, which is why we've invited HorseJS to come hang out at the conference and give a short talk. Be e-lightened by clever quips such as: "I didn't really need to write my own build system" and "already in the ES6 draft, it's too late now".

There's also a [photo booth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_booth) in the venue, which means that yes, you can take a series of four little black-and-white photos with HorseJS, as long as you provide a [sugar](https://npmjs.org/package/sugar) cube and an NPM module to convince.

We also got our [stickers delivered](https://twitter.com/nodepdx/status/332222519773917184/photo/1) and [t-shirts](http://twitpic.com/cp3kt6/full) ordered. You know you want one.

## Beverages

I [heard you like coffee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pswagEyDVn0), so we booked a barista that will be doing pour-overs from 8am-Noon on both days. There might be a bit of a line, but that's what the photo-booth and the walk-up IRC station is for. You can also enjoy either of those distractions during the Happy Hour on Friday night from 4:30pm-6pm (yes we know that's more than an hour).

## In Conclusion

I can't believe you read this whole email. Thanks for that. Please go tell everyone you know to join you for this magnificent experience we're calling NodePDX. 

Also, if you've read this far, you're probably a hard-worker. If you'd like to volunteer to help us out, shoot an email to [thoward37@gmail.com](mailto:thoward37@gmail.com?Subject=[NodePDX]%20Volunteers) or [lucperkins@gmail.com](mailto:lucperkins@gmail.com?Subject=[NodePDX]%20Volunteers).  

Thanks,
NodePDX Crew
