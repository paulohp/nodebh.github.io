Hi everyone! Things are shaping up well and we have some more interesting tidbits to share with you.

## Tickets

Ok, Early Bird tickets are going on sale *on Monday*. We will send another email, tweet, and generally be really loud about that on Monday, but if you want you can set an alarm, get out your sleeping bag and tent, camp outside your laptop and wait: 9am on Monday morning is the time. 


## Dance Party
So we worked it out to have the venue to ourselves all night. So, what to do? Naturally, we're booking a couple amazing local DJs and having a dance party/hackathon. That's right, dance, hack, dance, hack, visit the photo-booth, dance some more. From 8pm until 2:30am the doors will be open for an open-access dance party and hackathon. Got a co-worker or BFF who can't make the main event? Invite them out for the evening festivities. It's going to be a blast! Dancing and hacking 'til dawn not your thing? (ok, you're weird) but don't worry, we'll also be scheduling some additional peripheral events at near-by locations, for a quieter atmosphere. More on that later.


## Speakers

First, we're excited to announce the next round of speakers.


#### Thorsten Lorenz ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/thl0), [GitHub](https://github.com/thlorenz))

Thorsten just can't be stopped. Don't know Thorsten? Well, you might have seen the sweet [replpad](https://github.com/thlorenz/replpad) project or enjoyed the ease of debugging that [source map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) support for [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) has provided. You can thank Thorsten for that. Thorsten is going to school us on the "how and why" of writing small single-purpose JavaScript modules, something we think is super important.


#### Eva Giselle ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/evagiselle), [GitHub](https://github.com/evagiselle))

So, remember when Node wasn't around yet and client-side JavaScript was boring, and everyone was like "Sigh, I have to go write some JavaScript for this stupid webpage, and I don't even like it or know how to do it right, if there even is such a thing as doing it right." Now we're all amazing JavaScript musketeers, swashbuckling our way through the browser leaving little curly-braces laying around everywhere, chests full of pride, victory pumping through our veins. That is, until you hit that little bump in the road... CSS. Just when you were having fun in the browser, CSS goes and reminds you that you don't know what the heck you're doing. Well, luckily for us, Eva Giselle is an amazing web designer, illustrator, motion-graphicker and holds a black-belt in the art of snark. In Eva's talk, we'll learn about that last undrained lagoon of sludgy uncertainty: CSS.


#### Peter Braden ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/peterbraden), [GitHub](https://github.com/peterbraden))

Open your eyes, my little robot friend. What's that? Oh, nothing, just a flying drone with a camera on it and some wicked JavaScript code powering it. Peter Braden is going to enlighten you to the intricacies of putting a camera on a robot and processing those video streams to make decisions. Um, yeah, it's the future now.


#### Adam Ulvi ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/s5fs), [GitHub](https://github.com/aulvi))

It's spring time, and if you're anything like me, you've started weeding, tilling, and mixing manure into your soil, planting what will be the epic veggie crop of 2013. If you're also like me in totally another way, you've got Nagios running somewhere emailing you whenever your server farm gets low on disk space or high on CPU. Wouldn't it be awesome to have that kind of insight into your vegetable garden? Adam Ulvi is going to show you how to "put a sensor on it" so that you can monitor your raspberries with your Raspberry. Ok, mostly it's lettuce. But you can see where I'm going with this.


## Sponsors

Check out these great companies who are helping us to make this event happen.


#### Urban Airship

The hackers at [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com) are some of the first people I ran into at the quintessential "Cheers"-of-Portland-Tech-scene, [Bailey's Taproom](http://www.baileystaproom.com). They've got some of the brightest people in town building the best mobile push-notification system ever devised. Urban Airship has built a great product and an impressive company, basically starting from nothing (well nothing but a good idea and some righteous skills), and has stayed totally humble about it. In my mind, UA defines the Portland startup spirit as I know it. You might be thinking "oh, but I thought they were a Python shop." Turns out you can love Python AND JavaScript at the SAME TIME. Whoa. Mind. Officially. Blown.


#### New Relic

We're really happy to welcome back another alumni sponsor, [New Relic](http://newrelic.com). You may have gone to the after-party last year and enjoyed a beer on New Relic's dime. They are an awesome local company that continues to grow at an impressive rate. If you don't already have one, come to NodePDX if for no other reason than to get one of their rad t-shirts. Oh, and while you're at it, you just might want to try out their monitoring tools. Just maybe, cause you know, having metrics and deep insight into your application's performance is a good thing, 'mkay? And it's free. Duh.


#### Janrain

[Janrain](http://janrain.com) are a bunch of Haskell nerds... and Semantic Web nerds (and not too shabby at ping-pong). They are also parked literally right next to my favorite downtown coffee shop, [Barista](http://baristapdx.com). Need I say more? Ok, fine. Ever forgotten your password on a website and were totally relieved to see a "Sign in with Facebook" button? Well, Janrain didn't exactly invent OAuth, but they make that whole social-login user-management thing super easy and power like 99.9999% of all login pages (not an actual statistic). Try it!


#### Devion (Payment Processing Partner)

So, when you buy a ticket this year, you can thank [Devion](http://devion.com)  for enabling our payment processing. You can also thank them after you go sign a contract with them to build your next website and find yourself amazed at how nice it turned out and how friendly their support is. We're still not completely sure how to pronounce their name though. Is it like "DEV-EE-ON" or "DEE-VEE-ON"? Hopefully they can straighten us out on that at in person. I encourage you to chat them up at the conference and find out the answer (and then come tell me).
