Programming with a Purpose
========================

* Speaker   : Jason Denizac
* Available : duration of NodePDX 2013
* Length    : 20-45 mins

Description
-----------

As programmers we are wizards. Our job is to manufacture super powers. Like with the Manhattan Project, wielding such great technological power entails moral implications which we ignore at our peril. But we can recognize this power, embrace it, and use it for great good. Node gives us a tool kit to confront great problems and share in solving them.
Specifically: radical decomposition, horizontal reuse, and positive community norms around testing and documentation.

Audience participation requested: be prepared to share your expertise in a real world problem space like education, civics, social equity, environmental conservation, healthcare, or your own favorite "intractable" problem. If time and scheduling permits, I'd love to have a series of lightning talks in which people could introduce other developers to the problem domain.
