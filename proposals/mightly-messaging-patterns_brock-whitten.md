Description
-------------------------

Messaging is the lifeblood of distributed systems yet it is often treated as an afterthought when applications are architected. Few get passed the point of tacking on a message queue to fire and forget tasks with no visibility into what is happening on the system. I'm here to tell you we can do better. That Messaging can do more for us than just put tasks in the background. By combining basic messaging paradigms we can build powerful distributed systems with full awareness of what is happening around the network. And we can do it all in pure JavaScript.

In this talk, I will start with a crash course on the basic messaging patterns `push/pull`, `pub/sub`, and `request/reply` and then show a real example of how we have combined these patterns to build a custom message broker that we have used to build a fully distributed and modular architecture for the Harp Platform. I will share details about what we have learned and common pitfalls to avoid when building a messaging system for your needs.

Basic outline for the talk:

  - how messaging can be useful
  - crash course on the basic message patterns
  - how to get started with zeromq/axon
  - common pitfalls when in production
  - proven trade secrets we have learned

By the end of the talk, my hope is that everyone will have a new appreciation for what can be achieved with massaging and will know where to begin when attempting to integrate messaging into their next project. I feel this aspect of building modern web applications is often overlooked and viable techniques need to be shared and discussed.

Speaker Bio
-------------------------

Best know for having co-created PhoneGap, I went on to work at Joyent where I created the Public API for the beloved (and now sunset) No.de Platform. I am now working on the Harp Platform where we have created a dead simple publishing platform that uses Dropbox as its deployment mechanism. Much has been learned, I'd like to share.
