Description
-----------

Join Hanselman as he digs into the open source SDKs of Windows Azure. Let's access Azure from the command line and deploy and redeploy with Git. We'll fire up Linux VMs, setup Mongo and run node.js apps in the cloud. We'll look at things like SendGrid and New Relic. The future of the cloud is open and it's a hybrid. This very technical session will cover Windows and Mac, .NET as well as pinching pennies in the cloud.
