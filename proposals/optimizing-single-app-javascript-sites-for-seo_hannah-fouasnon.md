Optimizing Single-Page Javascript Websites for SEO
===================================================

Description
-----------

Creating single-page javascript websites enable developers to more easily support advanced web client features. For example, the persistent playing experience on [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) is supported by a single-page backbone.js architecture.  One of the downsides when deciding on this architecture is that web crawlers have trouble indexing content, which can hurt seo and facebook sharing.

This presentation covers how we solve this problem at [DJZ](http://djz.com). The example will be a simplified [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) application optimized for seo using primarily [phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/).  Viewers can follow along with code on github (link to come).
