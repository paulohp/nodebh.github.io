Open Ignite/Lightning Style Talks
========================

* Speaker   : Phillip Kerman (+ about 7 others)
* Available : 16 May 11AM or later and 17 May 11AM or later 
* Length    : No more than 1 hour (Though, the length depends on how many people I can get to sign up--perhaps schedule this before a break such as lunch?)

Description
-----------

I'll do a 5 minute ignite-style talk on "Guerilla JavaScript for the Flash Refugee" but I'll also campaign to get others to sign up.  It's a great chance for those who don't have enough material for a full session or, for whatever reason are not able to give a full conference session.  Cramming your content down to a dense nugget is a great exercise.



Speaker Bio
-----------

Phillip Kerman is a software programmer, teacher, and writer. He fancies himself a comedian though this claim has been widely disputed. His long and tiresome career as self-appointed expert using Macromedia/Adobe tools (including Authorware, Director, and finally Flash) has been marked with a not-coincidental demise of whatever technology Phillip has exploited.  Lately he’s found that declaring "Flash is Dead" has encouraged his customers to have him build native apps, convert to HTML5, or maintain/liquidate any cash cows before their eventual transition. His stint as the advice columnist “The Reluctant JavaScripter” was short living.
In recent years, he's had a series of seeming break-downs first spending 1 year to produce over 100 anti-technology satire videos (including the cult-classic Why Adobe Updater) and then turning to street performing his Vaudeville inspired act Handbills Delivered for which he has been physically removed from only two venues despite requests to leave and never return to over 6 cities at which he was uninvited to perform during 2010 and 2011. To this day the public continues to debate exactly which of Mr. Kerman's skills most contributed to his global stardom.
