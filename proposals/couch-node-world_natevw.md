# CouchDB + Node + World

* Speaker : Nathan Vander Wilt (@natevw)
* Available : from 11am Thursday to 3pm Friday
* Length : 30 min

(Hoping to actually be available the whole time and I can find many references who will attest that I can talk longer if necessary. Or shorter too, but wouldn't ask anyone to co-sign that loan.) 

## Description

Riddle: It started with photos, gained GPS logging, a blog system, a map editor, a henhouse egg graph and will soon involve aquaponics and sub-$5/node wireless networks.
Also it involves putting CouchDB+node.js systems "into production".

Give up? It's @natevw's unpaid/paid career! Orange you glad I didn't say webinar again?

I have no idea what that was either.

Expect even worse from this talk, as I will be covering everything from node.js feeding CouchDB random scraps of household data to lessons learned using node.js and CouchDB for "real" products.

We'll discuss why CouchDB is a good fit with node.js, why any of this is worth doing, some ideas and related projects for further integration between CouchDB and node.js.

And if it's not too enterprisey, I'll share a bit of my experience deploying a "real" application with node.js middleware talking to Cloudant's backend â€” what went well, what could have "gone better".

Then the talk will be over and you can have the mic and rip all my arguments to shreds. Or ask any questions, questions are nice.
