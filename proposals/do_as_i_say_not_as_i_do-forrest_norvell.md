* Length    : 30-50 minutes, organizer's discretion

Description
-----------

Forrest has spent the last year plumbing the depths of Node for New Relic, as he brings support for Node to New Relic. It's a process that has required ingenuity, guile, and the willingness to break a lot of otherwise very sensible rules. He will take you on a tour of some of the more powerful but dangerous tools in the JavaScript toolbox: monkey patching, working with Node's internals, and mixing synchronous and asynchronous code without setting your hair on fire.

Speaker Bio
-----------

Forrest is a software engineer who has spent the better part of the last two years working with Node full-time, first working on bringing Singly's Locker Project up to web scale, and then exploring the wilds of monitoring the performance of Node applications for New Relic. He has learned an unreasonable amount about JavaScript, V8, libuv, and making it all work well in the real world.
