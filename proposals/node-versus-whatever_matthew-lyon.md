# Node vs Rails vs Go vs Whatever

* Length    : 30-45m

## Description

Is Node a good fit for your new project?

Like many technologies that have quickly gained a lot of attention, there's
a fair amount of FUD coming out from the old guard about "node is a cancer" or
"you'll get stuck in callback hell".  They provide the poor performance of
fibonacci sequence algorithms and a lack of sophisticated threading as proof of
its failings, while downplaying its strengths.

Let's cut through the FUD and talk about what some good and bad use-cases for
node are in web apps. Not sure if you're IO or CPU-bound? Want to max out your
shiny new server? Worried about getting stuck in callback hell? Worry no more.
