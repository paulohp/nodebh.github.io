# Teaching Robots to See With Javascript

* Speaker : Peter Braden
* Available : May 16/17th etc.
* Length  : 45 mins


# Description

As we start to use javascript to control quadrocopters and robots, it becomes
important that they can _see_ with images from cameras onboard.

In this talk we'll take a step back and look at the field of computer vision;
look at some of the exciting practical problems that can be solved with CV
techniques, and look at how we can do this with javascript.

Whether it's detecting and recognising faces, building a picture of
surroundings from a video stream, or tracking shapes, we'll look at how we can
make our javascript programs see.

And all going well, we'll have a live demonstration of a drone navigating based
on onboard camera data.
