## Description

Reviewing the [online slides](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/) of this talk is the best way to
get an idea of what module driven development is about. The speaker notes appear in the browser console.

The main points are as follows:

- [what constitutes a module](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/1/3)
- why it is desirable to build smaller modules
- [challenges](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/2/1) and [patterns]( http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/2/2) for separating the application into independent modules
- [process](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/2/3) of pulling out a module from an application
- [replpad case study](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/4)
- how to become module driven [phase1](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/9) and [phase2](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/9/1)
- [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and how it enables to even manage your client side modules with npm
- quick primer on [tools](http://thlorenz.github.com/module-driven-development/#/9/2) like `npm init`, pkginit, travisify and `npm link`
  that help with module driven development

## Speaker Bio

Thorsten Lorenz has been creating nodejs projects for over two years mostly in his spare time. The main reason why he can't stop is, that
ideas can be transformed into something that works in a very short amount of time when implemented in JavaScript.

Aside from these projects, he also contributes to projects he thinks to be important for the community. 
His most recent contribution is adding source map support to [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). 
These source maps even allow debugging transpiled languages (i.e. CoffeeScript) right in the browser.

Thorsten believes that writing small modules instead of frameworks and managing them with npm is an important trend and enjoys
educating others about it.
