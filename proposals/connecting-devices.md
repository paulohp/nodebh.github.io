Description
-----------

Hundreds of millions of devices will come online in the next few years. Light bulbs, air conditioners and televisions will all be addressable via the internet. This talk discusses the state-of-the-art in protocols for connecting these devices, the problems in connecting a device with 4K of memory to the internet, and how Ninja Blocks aims to help solve these problems with Node.js.

Further, Ninja Blocks hopes to run workshops showing people the tools we've built to talk to these devices, and share them with the world. And bring lots of cool toys to hack on too.
