[Realtime Hardware with Node.js]
========================

* Speaker   : Nexxy _(Emily Rose)_
* Available : ~~Always, all the time~~ Most of the time
* Length    : Until I drop the mic and walk off stage, or something catches fire (whichever comes first).*


\* Probably about 20-30 minutes plus however long it takes for the smoke to clear.

Description
-----------

Join us for another installment of "Realtime Hardware with Node.js" as we take a look at just 
how exactly one should go about making a fool of themselves on stage with a bunch of electronics.
We will cover the basics of getting started with hardware, demonstrate some cool tech, and conclude
with a super rad (slightly hazy) and interactive dance party of epic (modest) proportions â€” if everyone cooperates.
Questions are welcome throughout the presentation, and audience members are _encouraged_* to participate.
