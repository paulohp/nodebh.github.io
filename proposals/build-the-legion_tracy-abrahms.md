Build the Legion: growing community in Node.js
========================

* Speaker   : Tracy Abrahms 
* Available : It's all good, wo/man. 
* Length    : 30 minutes

Description
-----------

We have the opportunity as Node.js matures to amplify its traction--to build a diverse legion of programmers.
We can grow the community by promoting the framework as a really unique opportunity to unite factions--polyglots, 
Front-end vs. Back-end, the dabblers/weekend warriors, converting the monolingual.

I trolled PyCon. The Python Community is known for, well, having a strong sense of community.  They even helped
to build a Ruby community. Friggin' do-gooders. Do we want to co-opt this? Using the power of so many different 
programmer language backgrounds contributing to the Javascript realm, why not take the best pieces and build solid
grounding? Even better, people love to hate. Why not take what we all 
hate about other languages and make sure to avoid the pitfalls.

Why do we need diversity(expecting a large onslaught of tomatoes thrown on-stage *here*)?

How do we go about building this? What's my evil plan? What's my stake in this? 
So many more questions than answers, and I love to play devil's advocate.

Rally time. Mentors! Workshops! Better documentation to welcome newcomers!

Speaker Bio
-----------

Prior work in advertising and healthcare administration short-circuited Tracy's brain and her ability to make sound decisions,
so she quit her job and insanely chose to focus on programming and the anthropological study of the Hacker. 
When she isn't monkeying up rocks/trees or bicycling to and from the glorious amount of tech meetups in Portland,
she's talking your ear off about them(or anything else she's read about that day). You have been warned.
