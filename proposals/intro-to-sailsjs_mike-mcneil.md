## Description

<a href="http://sailsjs.com">Sails.js</a> makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.

Sails empowers UX and design teams to build hi-fi prototypes in no time without waiting for the back-end to be finished.  This means focusing more resources on the user experience, which means better products. One Sails.js project at a time, companies move their legacy architecture over to a simpler, more efficient Node.js cloud. Each new client-side code base is more maintainable, since itâ€™s built using the universal language of the internet: a RESTful JSON API.


## Speaker Bio
I'm Mike, a developreneur based out of Austin, Texas and connoisseur of fine code.  I'm also the creator of Sails.js, the open-source BaaS framework which allows front-end developers to build robust, scalable APIs using only JavaScript.

My <a href="http://www.sencha.com/apps/blinktop/">first startup</a> was in social television, where I saw the need for more efficient, easy-to-use solutions for realtime social features.  Because of that, I got involved in Node.js early on, and after building a few early apps, recognized the need for an MVC solution to normalize patterns.  Early last year, I founded <a href="http://balderdash.co">Balderdash</a>, a UX-focused mobile and web studio, which has given me an excellent opportunity to build out and utilize Sails.js in production.
