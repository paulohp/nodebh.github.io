My Sensors Love Node.js
========================

* Speaker   : Ward Cunningham
* Available : May 16, 17
* Length    : 45 minutes

Description
-----------

I've tested a half-dozen home sensor integration technologies over as many years and learned
something important about architecture with each generation. I've replaced Arduino hardware
with Teensy which offers much better USB support. I've replace C++ with Perl then with Ruby/Sinatra
and now Node/Wiki each time feeling the fresh air of a more friendly and dynamic environment.
I've plotted results with ascii-art, java-2d, flot and now d3.js which can be a career in itself.
I'll share the good parts of each of these and suggest how you will know when it is time for
you to move on.

Speaker Bio
-----------

The Oregonian describes me as the Old Growth of the Silicon Forest. I appreciate the thought
but move way too fast to be compared to trees. Think of me as your intellectual immune system
separating good technology infections from bad. Ditch that fever. Go with node.
