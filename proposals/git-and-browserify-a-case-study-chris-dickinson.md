Implementing Git in JavaScript & the Browser: A Case Study
==========================================================

* Speaker   : Chris Dickinson

* Length    : 30-45 minutes (prefer 45, but can trim it down)

Description
-----------

Git is one of my [favorite things](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git.js/tree/chris) to 
[hack on](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/tempisfugit). It's long been my
goal to get a working (workable?) implementation of git running in pure JS, in
the browser. My first attempt two years ago failed; and for a long time I've
let the thought bounce around in the back of my head.

Spurred on by the [recent interest in js-git](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/creationix/js-git), I
recently restarted the journey towards an in-browser git, in order to help
creationix deliver the best possible js-git. Newly armed with browserify
and the small-module ethos, I've come much closer to a working git in browser
and Node, and in the process have really put browserify and its shims through 
their paces.

This talk will be comprised of:

* A quick intro to the git object model and transport protocol
* How browserify and the small module ethos have enabled great
  successes in the project. 
* Difficulties encountered in the process, both with Node.JS itself
  and with browserify, and how I've worked through them.
* How I've diagnosed and worked through various performance issues.
* Where is this project going?

I make silly things with JavaScript: I particularly love bit-twiddling
and WebGL-based projects. I live in Portland OR and work at Urban Airship
as a JavaScript engineer.
