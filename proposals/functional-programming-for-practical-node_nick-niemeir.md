Functional Programming for Practical Node
=========================================

* Speaker   : Nick Niemeir
* Available : May 16th or 17th
* Length    : 45min

Description
-----------

We'll be examining practical functional techniques that work well with JavaScript.
Focusing on how they interact with node's core abstractions; the
(error, results) callback, event emitters, and streams. We will see the
compounding benefits of pure functions through reusability and composability.
And generally geek out about how much easier programing is if we avoid
unnecessarily mutating state.
