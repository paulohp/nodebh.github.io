Full-Stack Testing with JavaScript and Node.js
==============================================

* Speaker   : Ryan Roemer
* Available : May 16-17
* Length    : 45 mins

Description
-----------

We are currently witnessing a JavaScript renaissance at all levels of the
application stack. On the front-end, modern frameworks such as Backbone.js soar
in popularity. On the back-end, Node.js continues its meteoric rise.

At the same time, *testing* JavaScript web applications continues to be
difficult and ad-hoc, particularly on the front-end. What if the front-end was
(nearly) as easy to test as the back-end? What if we could use the *same* tools
to test both?

In this talk, we will explore a unified approach to testing end-to-end
JavaScript applications using tools like Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.JS, making
things easy, extensible, and conveniently... *similar*. In addition to the
basics of setting up and running a combined test architecture, we will also
touch on subjects such as:

* Writing and testing shared code between the browser/server with AMD/RequireJS.
* Automating and driving front-end/back-end tests from the command line using
  PhantomJS and Node.js.
