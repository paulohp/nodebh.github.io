# Let's Make Music!

* Speaker: Matthew Lyon
* Available: all
* Length: 30-45m

## Description

Music happens over time and so does asynchronous code. Therefore, let's write
music in Javascript! We'll build a network sound sequence server that will talk
to freely-available softsynths and possibly an HTML5 Audio API, covering how to
model things such as drum patterns, melodies, oscillators and pattern banks.

## Speaker Bio

Matthew Lyon is a lover of dynamic languages and synthesizers. He has built or
contributed to a good chunk of the user-facing code at Portland-based startup
AppFog.
